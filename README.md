# Hitstart
An ULTRAKILL mod that lets you change the amount of hitstop.

It's 0 by default. If you want to change it, go to your Steam launch parameters and add: "hitstop_x". The hitstop length is multiplied by x, the number you input into the Steam launch parameters.

x can be any number including decimals, though any number under 0 will behave the same as 0 due to the way hitstop functions.
